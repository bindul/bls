# Bowling League Stats

A fun side project to track and show league bowling stats created for the **Pins Go Boom!**
bowling team. Written in React with a few libraries, this is also Bindul's *first React project*,
hence the code and design isn't the prettiest. It was primarily figure out the language as
you code piece.

The code is currently hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) at **[bls.bindul.name](https://bls.bindul.name)**

All data used by the site are held as `JSON` files as part of the static hosting at GH Pages.
The data itself is managed using a (*pseudo*) desktop application (code at [BLS Data Management](https://github.com/bindul/bls-dm)).
